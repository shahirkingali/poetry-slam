0. Capitalism by "quietlikemurder" 

1. I am a force of nature.
2. my winds are wasted on retail,
3. but sometimes surviving takes precedence over living.
4. sometimes you have to sell your soul to pay your rent;
5. itâ€™s ugly business, but technically legal.
6. I wonder when,
7. if ever,
8. we will have given enough of ourselves
9. to the continuation of a system
10. that traps wildfires in jars until they suffocate,
11. poaches dragons and crafts
12. handbags from their scales,
13. reduces gods to marketable cartoon characters,
14. takes everything beautiful,
15. everything beyond comprehension,
16. and finds a way to sell it to the masses.
17. I wonder when my hurricane
18. will crash on the shores of your
19. empire of plastic.
20. I wonder if you know
21. your name is on the tongues of every
22. dead-end revolutionary,
23. every act of god,
24. and you
25. are not long for our world.
26. I wonder
27. if your profits
28. will rent your business a nice lot in the graveyard,
29. or your soul a kinder hell.
30. I wonder if you recall
31. by whose mercy
32. you were allowed to flourish
33. in the first place.
